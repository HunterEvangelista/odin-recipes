    <h3>Low Cal Meets High Protein</h3>
    <p>One of the things I am passionate about is working out and trying to build muscle. The best weapon to be successful in this endeavor is to have a wide range of healthy meals that are low calorie, filling, and have a high protein content. It helps that the healthy gut bacteria in greek yogurt helps with digestion too. 
    </p>
    <p> You can take this recipe as is or remove the granola and freeze it with other add-ins to create greek yogurt cookies. This recipe is simple and can be used as a quick breakfast or a night time snack to keep you full</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>170g of fat-free unflavored greek yogurt. (I prefer Chobani)</li>
        <li>1 scoop of protein powder, I use Vanilla On. Anything that mixes in will work!</li>
        <li>1tsp of Cinnanom</li>
        <li>Granola</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Directions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together greek yogurt, protein powder, and cinnamon. It wil look like too much at first but it'll combine.</li>
        <li>Top with a little bit of granola for texture and enjoy your easy and quick healthy snack. This yogurt has nearly 50g of protein and only 300 calories.</li>
    </ol>
