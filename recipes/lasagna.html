    <h3>The Perfect Blue Collar Lasagna</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite lasagna that my wife makes me when I get back from a long day
        working in the steel mill. When I feel depressed from the long winters or low pay I reflect on 
        how this recipe always makes me feel better. Starting with the perfectly cooked noodles that build the foundation for the meal and ending with a generous topping of heart healthy cheese, I can eat this every week!

    </p>
    <p> The ingredients are simple and easy to get; however, the beauty of this recipe is it allows for some leeway with the ingredients that you choose! You can find everything you need at your local Wal-Mart.</p>
